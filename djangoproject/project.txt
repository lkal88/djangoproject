Definite features:
- Search function
- Type/subjects/tags to categorise. Type of event: talk, competition, opportunity and subject: finance, Engineering, tech, Professional Development, entrepreneurship etc.
- university of the student + photo for the event users to see.
- Should have a notification system and saving.
- Testimonials from students who have completed the program(?) No MLMs.
    What does this achieve? Reliable info about the events.
- Should be able to save certain events.
- AIESEC events, Project Everest events etc.
- Has restrictions in red text: e.g RSVP only, UNSW only etc. Selection only etc. 
- How do we make it more fun? We can include testimonials from users that have participated. Linkedin shares posts, facebook
and eventbrite don't have this feature.
- Also need multiple dates if it runs for multiple sessions
-



THE PROBLEM - keep it simple:
- Students find it hard to find opportunities in their space. Product should focus on discovery!. unsw.events, KPMG hackathon
- E.g Linkedin ads, facebook ads, university ads, website ads make it hard to find and search.
- Eventbrite isn't really related to opportunities and scholarships, more culture/music/business based. Also event discovery is not appreciated.
- Students want to be able to see what they want to do (GCG, link japan, India Volunteer exchange, hackathons, networking opportunities, etc.)
- Most professional companies have to have their own registration form etc.
- Bloomberg training, Bain information night. UNSW events. These events are only listed on their website!. Central data hub for all events.
- Need to sign up on their website.
- Maybe the HR and event creators can successfully target specific people - people from their company, mckinsey etc.
- HOW DO WE MAKE IT MORE FUN/COMPETITIVE? AKA LOOK AT EVENTS, WHERE MOST ATTENDEES THAT WENT TO THESE EVENTS END UP/WORK AT.
- Initially try get university events/organisations, 180 degrees, AIESEC, GCG, etc. Profiles should have universities to see which events apply.
- If a company has restriction to a specific university, has to have a restrictions tag.
- Should it just link to the event, notifications or save? - should have a notifications system.
- Instead of attending; should be interested similar to FB?. Able to leave TESTIMONIALS.
- Should have speakers attending etc. At the moment, should not be a social network. should focus on event discovery etc for students in specific universities and HS.
COMPETITORS:
- Meetup - more for local events, most similar, avg traction. Poor discovery features. Not really specific for students or professional events.
- They use groups to coordinate interests.
- GENERAL ASSEMBLY!!! - HAS A GOOD EVENTS SYSTEM. THINK OF HOW TO REPLICATE.
- Similar events = not really a thing.
HR wants:
- information on their candidate and list of all the people attending.
- In their registration, they request preference for offices, and if they are currently attending school.
- May be able to enter the core information, such as currently in school, LGBT etc in their profile (only visible to potential HR employers)
- Add testimonials to events. People want to find out which upcoming events they attending and which events they attended.
- Put privacy mode on individual events.

THE PRODUCT:
- Make an event that is able to be classified easily, finance, networking, design, exchange opportunities (tags?)
An ideal event should have:
- Title
- Description
- Company/University held by.
- Link to their own website/form/etc.
- Date published
- Date of event (range)
- City/Address held.
- WHO IS ELIGIBLE.NO (UNSW STUDENTS only, UNSW engineers only, students only. etc.) needs to be based on school? Just red text or something.
- tags/category (type of event, subjects)
- Series: A global series of chats etc. previous year etc.
- Testimonials, can be anonymous or use profile.
- Can share events on linkedin!

- If it is a sequence of events, should be able to be linked to past events (e.g 2017 Consulting comp, 2018 consulting comp.)
- Be able to leave a review for the competition - e.g Participant of the event, 1st place of the event.
- Also think about trade shows? How will a range of companies be affected?
- Previous attendees who have attended prior. (maybe need mobile app for this stuff.)
- Past events
- List of attendees - who can be visible?
- Testimonies?

Core events:
- opportunities
- competitions
- credentials gains
- should also be categorised into different fields (volunteering, finance, consulting, networking etc)
- Enough categories to be interesting, a category can be clicked on and all the kinds of events will appear on it.


Companies:
- Once you click on a company, it comes up with their company profile?
- Either login through linkedin or facebook. However, some companies such as unsw engineering don't have linkedin.
- Has a description of what they do and past events they've held.
- Probably should include a search function for say credit suisse that holds hackathons, competitions/events in different countries.

Profiles:
- Name
- Linkedin link/profile (may login through linkedin if possible?)
- Current student of #, current position at which company/society.
- Event attended/applied for.
- Privacy settings.




MARKETING:
Students:
- Mass market to UNSW students through zID spamming.
- Whirlpool forums.
- Target market: the
- UNSW has a lot of events for students that are only advertised on their website. Same with UTS, USYD etc.
- Student societies such as AIESEC, etc.


Companies:
- Mass email spam companies that are advertising to students through facebook and linkedin.


Possible issues:
annual events are hard to hold, more students looking for events that events/opportunities that are held.
trade expos that involve multiple companies.
