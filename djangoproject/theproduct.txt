The product:
What are currently the 5+ main points in events? MVP



1. It is very hard to discover relevant events:
- Facebook, unsw, linkedin, etc. all have different ways of discovery.

Solution:
Introduction of tags that allow events to be easily discovered. Can be clicked on to find relevant categories.
Introduce grouping of events to see past events - e.g Part of a series etc.
#Introduce testimonials and reviews of experiences of the event. Maybe able to include instagram posts or linkedin to it but seems excessive atm. (Maybe dont include this feature in MVP)
Make it shareable through social networks etc. When a company creates an event, ask if they would like to share it on linkedin etc.
Introduction of a search function with filters.
Social - people can look at other people's profiles to see which professional events they're attending?
- People can write testimonials of their time on the event pages/ company pages.
- Project Everest, Unbound, etc. 


2. It is hard to see how good an event is based on what you're interested in.
Adding tags to people to see what events they're into.
- Make it so people can give put their profiles on their resume.


Growth:
- Make it shareable through social networks. The product also must offer something eventbrite, meetup and facebook cannot/ different. e.g filters instagram.
- Allow banners/images uploads to the website browse.
- Why do companies use eventbrite? Automated app system to release tickets. Competitor to ticketek.
- Discovery - the tag system.
- Company profile - testimonials about their events on their company profile;
- Event groups - AIESEC Opportunities, Project Everest, Ted Talks.


Strategy:
- Sign up universities first - tons of universities offer events in the system.
- Start with companies such as GA, etc.
- Move on to bigger companies once traction gains?
- Install a share link that exposes to other systems.

Separation:
- How does the website become valuable in comparison to other event apps such as facebook, eventbrite, meetup, linkedin etc?
- What stops competitors from cloning?
- Shows people attending with linkedin integration, professionals. Facebook just shows their friends/photos etc.
- Shows list of people attending. (You can only look at the list if your registered user.)
- Shows testimonials of people who have previously attended the event.
- MAYBE PAYMENT OF TICKETS??
- Possibly add a live feed during the event? for startcon it could work because different talks.
- MAIN THING IS RECOMMENDATIONS! BECAUSE WE KNOW THE CITY YOU'RE IN YOUR MAJOR, ETC. WE CAN RECOMMEND THE BEST EVENTS TO YOU EVEN IF ITS GLOBAL!
